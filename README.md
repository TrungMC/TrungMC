- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m TrungMC@
- ðŸ‘€ I love programming and playing computer games. Been working with TurboPascal and TurboVision, Visual Basic 6, Delphi, C#, php and currenty mostly Python for the last 30 years. Trained as a businessman majoring in businese and laws, being a co-founder of rather successful companies in technology, I spend the majority of my time on programming and enjoy the designs of the top games available on the market which are truely masterpieces of programming to me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis and Data Science and currently in love with Odoo which I believe is a true business platform for programmers.
